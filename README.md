# Data_Science_cw2

Coursework 2 of Data Science Module at Imperial College London

This project is part of the Data Science module at Imperial College London, MSc in Statistics programme. The project aims to produce a professional statistical analysis report. 

The project will work on the dataset concerning the CHURN of telecom customers from Iranian companies, available on the UCI website maintained by (Dua and Graff 2019). This project will focus on investigating:

- Exploratory Data Analysis of the dataset
- Regression Modelling by different regressor methods
- Model diagnostics and further discussions


## Software and packages Used

All the code is writen in **R**, run in the Rstudio. The final statistical analysis report is created by .tex document using **LaTeX**, knitted by the online editing platform Overleaf. 

Notice that though running the source scripts and/or the .tex document by other software/platform should give the same result, output might be slightly effected if different software/platform is used. To ensure the best reproducibilty please run all documents as the softwares/platforms stated above. 

## Folder Structure

The code and analysis are structured as follows: 

### data 

- Sub-directory: raw, derived

This directory contains all raw and derived datasets used in this projects. 

Raw data (.zip file) can be found on this website. Time collected of raw data from the above website: April 2024. 


More information and background can be found in [this paper](). 

### scr 

The scourse folder contains the definitions/scripts for the pre-defined functions used in the analysis. 

### analyses

The analyses directory contains all code used to analyse the data and/or to produce the contents in the "outputs" folder. 

### outputs

- Sub-directory: figures

Contains all 

### reports

This folder contains all document to produce the final jourlism piece to submit, it contains mainly the .tex documents which writes the report in LaTeX. Notice the LaTeX document needs the output tables/figures from the "output" folder.
